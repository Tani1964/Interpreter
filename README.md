### Instructions on How to Run the Program

To utilize the interpreter shell, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Interpreter Shell**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the program files. Then, execute the following command:

```bash
python shell.py
```

2. **Input an Arithmetic Expression**: Once the shell is running, you'll see a prompt. Input an arithmetic expression following standard mathematical syntax. For example:

```python
1 + 2 + (3 * 4)
```

3. **Observe Output**: After entering the expression, the interpreter will process it and display either the output of the frontend phase of compilation or the intermediate states of interpretation.

## Rules
To ensure smooth functioning of the program, adhere to these rules:

1. **Input Limitations**: The interpreter currently only accepts integers and floating-point numbers.
2. **Bracket Notation**: Use curved brackets "()" to denote mathematical grouping or parentheses within expressions. Avoid using other types of brackets.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use the interpreter for your mathematical expressions.
